# NL2SQL
From Natural Language to SQL query generator
## Natural Language to SQL | SQL Query Generator using Langchain ü¶úÔ∏èüîó 
This repository contains code for a Streamlit application for interaction with SQLite3 database or a csv using natural language and generate the SQL query and consequent result. Also added examples for langchain demo to demonstrate the use of langchain simple llm calls and running chains using templates. 

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore how various technologies can be implemented to enhance SQL queries using LLM, and LangChain, a natural language processing library. We aim to improve the efficiency and accuracy of SQL query writing by enabling users to input a few examples and have the system generate the corresponding SQL queries.
